Need help with the cash register freeCodeCamp assignment. I Cannot for the life of me figure out how to pass the last two requirements:

9. When price is 19.5, the value in the #cash element is 20, cid is [["PENNY", 0.01], ["NICKEL", 0], ["DIME", 0], ["QUARTER", 0], ["ONE", 1], ["FIVE", 0], ["TEN", 0], ["TWENTY", 0], ["ONE HUNDRED", 0]], and the #purchase-btn element is clicked, the value in the #change-due element should be "Status: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"

10. When price is 19.5, the value in the #cash element is 20, cid is [["PENNY", 0.5], ["NICKEL", 0], ["DIME", 0], ["QUARTER", 0], ["ONE", 0], ["FIVE", 0], ["TEN", 0], ["TWENTY", 0], ["ONE HUNDRED", 0]], and the #purchase-btn element is clicked, the value in the #change-due element should be "Status: CLOSED PENNY: $0.5"
